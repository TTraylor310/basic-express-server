# Server 'basic express server'

## Author: Tim Traylor

* AWS: 'http://traybasicexpress-env.eba-trpdxvwy.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/'
* CLI: 'http://basics-2-dev.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/'

### Process

Loading the server to Elastic Beanstalk was pretty easy for me on this one. A virtual 'cloud' computer makes sense. It was easy to set up through the GUI and just as easy through the CLI. Currently running Linux Ubuntu 22+ and it gave zero errors setting up.
